Completed as part of a graduate course at the University of Toronto | Tensorflow, Python, OpenAI gym.

- Conducted a failure mode analysis on learned DDPG-based policies used to control a dexterous hand with tactile sensors, in an attempt to understand the utility of tactile information.
- The experiments were conducted using the OpenAI gym, Mujoco Simulator, and Tensorflow.
- Video, a full report, and the corresponding code is available here.
