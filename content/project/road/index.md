Completed as part of a graduate course at the University of Toronto | PyTorch.

- Implemented a Fully Connected Network based Road Segmentation pipeline on Audiâ€™s A2D2 dataset using PyTorch and OpenCV.
- Implemented the late and early fusion strategy published by L. Caltagirone et. al. and achieved an average precision of over 90%.
- Video, a full report, and the corresponding code is available here.
