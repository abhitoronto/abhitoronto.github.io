Completed as part of a graduate course at the University of Toronto | PyTorch.

- Implemented a Fully Connected Network based Road Segmentation pipeline on Audiâ€™s A2D2 dataset using PyTorch and OpenCV.
- Implemented the late and early fusion strategy published L. Caltagirone et. al. and achieved average precision of more than 90% on the new dataset.
- A full report and video are available along with the code.
