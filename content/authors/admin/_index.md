I am currently a research student at University of Toronto, adviced by [Dr. Jonathan Kelly](https://starslab.ca/people/). I am broadly interested in the topic of [robot manipulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics#Manipulation) and my current research focuses on [tactile perception]({{<ref "/#featured">}}). I am a receipient of the [NSERC Canadian Graduate Scholarship](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsm-bescm_eng.asp) and [Vector Scholarship in AI](https://vectorinstitute.ai/scholarship/).

I graduated from University of Waterloo with a bachelors in [Mechatronics Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/mechatronics-engineering) and an [option in AI](https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/ENG-Artificial-Intelligence-Engineering-Option). I worked as a research assitant for [Dr. Krzysztof Czarnecki](https://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/kczarnec), [Dr. Mihaela Vlasea](https://msam.uwaterloo.ca/team/mihaela-vlasea/), and [Dr. James Tung](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/profile/j6tung). For 12 months, I worked as an intern at [Nvidia US](https://developer.nvidia.com/drive) where I contributed to their self-driving infrastructure. Through various co-ops and internships, I graduated with over 2 years of [work experience]({{<ref "/#experience">}}).
